Project Title: End-to-End Data Analysis with Power BI
Project Overview
In this project, I conducted an end-to-end data analysis using Power BI to derive actionable insights from a dataset related to [insert specific topic, e.g., sales performance, customer behavior, etc.]. The analysis aimed to uncover trends, identify key metrics, and provide visual representations that facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

Explore the Data: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
Clean and Transform: Prepare the data for analysis by addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Analyze Trends: Identify significant trends and patterns over time or across different categories.
Visualize Insights: Create interactive dashboards and reports that effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.
